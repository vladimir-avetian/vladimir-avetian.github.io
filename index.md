I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [«Governance and Regulation» Chair](https://chairgovreg.fondation-dauphine.fr/fr/node/1) of the University Paris-Dauphine - PSL. 

I received my PhD in Economics from Sciences Po under supervision of [Sergeï Guriev](https://sites.google.com/site/sguriev/). 

My research interests are Applied Microeconomics, Political Economy and Urban Economics.

I also organise ["Public Governance" working group](https://acss-dig.psl.eu/fr/seminaires/public-governance) -- online seminar series focused on state of art research in political economy that uses non-traditional data and data-intensive methods.

My CV is available [here](pdfs/cv.pdf).
