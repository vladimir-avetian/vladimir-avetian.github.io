###Consider the Slavs: Overt Discrimination and Racial Disparities in the Rental Housing

Does discrimination lead to racial gaps in economic outcomes? Usually, discrimi- nation is covert, which makes it difficult to study. In this paper I concentrate on a unique market of Moscow rental housing, where landlords discriminate overtly: on average, 20 percent of ads from a major rental website include racial prefer- ences. I document that discrimination generates a racial differential in rents: com- paring apartments in the same building with identical observable characteristics, non-discriminatory apartments have a 4% higher price. I also run a correspondence experiment to explore the relationship between overt and subtle forms of discrimina- tion. I find that both forms coexist in the market. The proportion of overt to covert discrimination is stable across neighbourhoods. The average effect is consistent with random search model with discrimination. However, heterogeneity analysis contra- dicts some predictions of the model. I show how adding neighbourhood sorting to the model can explain spatial heterogeneity of a racial rent differential.
