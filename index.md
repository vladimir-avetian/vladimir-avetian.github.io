I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at the [«Governance and Regulation» Chair](https://chairgovreg.fondation-dauphine.fr/fr/node/1) of the University Paris-Dauphine - PSL. 

I received my PhD in Economics from Sciences Po under supervision of [Sergeï Guriev](https://sites.google.com/site/sguriev/). 

*Research interests:* Applied Micro, Political Economy, Culture and Urban Economics. 

*Research Methods:* Causal Inference, Unstructured Data, Big Data.

I organise ["Public Governance" online seminar](https://acss-dig.psl.eu/fr/seminaires/public-governance) focused on Political Economy + Data Science.

My CV is available [here](pdfs/cv.pdf).

As a Russian citizen, I am against the military aggression in Ukraine, call for its cessation, and condemn Putin's dictatorial regime.
